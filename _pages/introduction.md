title: Our Definition of "Advanced FTC Control System"
---

Our software development environment and hardware components of a competitive FTC control system consist of the following:

  1. Android studio is installed and Java is the programming language used.

  2. Git is installed and github is used for team work and remote testing.

  3. One REV control hub and one REV expansion hub. 

  4. Six to the max of eight motors need to be controlled.

  5. Two to three odometry wheels need to be programmed using motion planning library such as Roadrunner and PID controls in FTC core library .

  6. Four to the max of twelve servos need to be controlled

  7. One camera need to be programmed using openCV.

  8. State machine is implemented whenever applied.

  9. Sensors such as IMU, color, distance and others may or may not be needed.


We assume programmers are familiar with Java programming and comfortable with running commands in a terminal.
